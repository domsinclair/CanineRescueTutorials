# Canine Rescue Tutorials

These tutorials are designed to be an introduction to creating a full stack web application with [Vue Designer](https://vuedesigner.com/) being used as the primary tool to configure and design the front end.

<br>

## Pre-Requisites

<br>

You will need a computer which can be either Windows or Mac based. On that you will need to have Vue Designer, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and or [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) (ideally with the [Laravel Idea](https://laravel-idea.com/) extension), [DB Browser for SQLite](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.12.2), php 8.1+, Composer, and Nodejs.

It is assumed that you have a basic working knowledge of html, css (we'll be using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)) and Javascript. In addition you will need a basic understanding of Php. There is an excellent free starter course [here](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners-2023-edition) which we can heartily recommend. Last but by no means least some knowledge of SQL would be to your advantage.

In all cases we will do our best to explain the principles here and give you some general pointers but it cannot be emphasised enough that you need to understand the principles so that you can successfully take what you learn here and transfer those skills to your own projects.

The tutorial code is in its own github repository. The Main branch represents the finished article (or if you are following along at the time this series was originally conceived the most up to date iteration). The Initial branch represents the project in its base configuration. This is the branch that we would recommend you fork in order to follow along and hopefully derive the most from the series.

If you have any direct questions about the tutorials please raise them in the Discussions section in this repository of in the [Vue Designer Discord Group](https://discord.com/invite/CeXtx8hXYf).

If you notice or encounter a specific technical issue with the tutorials then please raise an issue in the Issues section in this repository.
