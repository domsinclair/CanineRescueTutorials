# Dummy Data

Now that you've had the chance to experiment with creating data models and migrations (and quite possibly factories and controllers as well) it's time to look at how we can add some data into those tables to aid our development.

When our application is finally deployed the database itself will probably be empty of data or at least the vast majority of it will be. During the building phase though having mock data to use will be very beneficial. It will allow us to test the application thoroughly and it will also help when it comes to designing the views that are going to be used to both display and enter data.

Study this section carefully and make sure that really understand the concepts. You'll be doing this a lot and it needs to become second nature.
