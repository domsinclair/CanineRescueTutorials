# Command Aliasing

<br>

By now it's just possible that continually typing out commands like `php artisan serve` or `npm run dev` may be getting a little tiresome, and you may well be making errors as you so.

Well as it happens there's something that can be done about that and it's known as aliases.

The way to achieve this differs depending upon whether you are working on a Mac or a Windows machine but essentially you will be doing the same thing.

In essence you create a batch file into which you add the aliases that you want to have available at the command prompt.

For example you might want to have nrd to be the alias for npm run dev.

It's very east to get carried away with these once you get started, the secret to efficiency is to create aliases for only those commands that you use the most often and to use aliased mnemonics that are easy to remember / guess.

For Mac users [here's a simple video explaining what to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOGqms6BizE).

For Windows users you might want to check out something like [Cmder](https://cmder.app/).

> <strong>You do not have to employ aliases. They will not make you a better programmer. However they may save you a lot of time in the long run if you are constantly typing out the same commands at the terminal. The choice is entirely up to you. </strong>
